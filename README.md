## **Using POST Instead of GET**
If you change your form and controller to use **POST** instead of **GET**, here are the key changes:

- Change the form method to `post` in your HTML.
- Update your controller to use `@PostMapping` instead of `@GetMapping`.

## **Key Differences Between GET and POST**

| Feature                  | GET                                      | POST                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Parameters in URL         | Appended to URL as query string         | Sent in the request body                  |
| Security                  | Less secure, visible in URL             | More secure for sensitive data           |
| Data Length               | Limited by URL length                   | Can send large amounts of data           |
| Idempotency               | Safe to repeat (does not change state)  | Not necessarily idempotent               |
| Use Case                  | Retrieving data                         | Sending data / creating / updating data  |


### GET request:
http://localhost:8080/calculator?num1=10&num2=5&operation=add
### POST request:
http://localhost:8080/calculator

## **Usage**
1. Open the application in a browser (default: `http://localhost:8080/index.html`)
2. Enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operation
3. Click **Calculate**
4. View the result or error message
